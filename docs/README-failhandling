Error Handling, Retry Strategy, and Dead Letter Queues in RabbitMQ

By default, when a message processing error occurs and no retry configuration is defined, RabbitMQ may enter a
loop, repeatedly attempting to process the same message without success.

To prevent this behavior, you can configure retry policies in the application.properties file using parameters such as:

max-attempts
initial-interval
multiplier
max-interval

These properties control the number of retry attempts, the initial delay, the growth rate between attempts,
and the maximum interval between retries.

Dead Letter Queues and Exchanges
A Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) and its corresponding Dead Letter Exchange (DLX) are mechanisms used to handle
"dead" messages â€” those that could not be successfully processed. Instead of losing the message or halting the flow,
the message is redirected to another queue for future processing or inspection.

Quick Setup with QueueBuilder
You can quickly configure a dead letter exchange in your queue setup using QueueBuilder.
Simply pass the DLX name using the method:

java
Copy
Edit
QueueBuilder.durable("main.queue")
            .withArgument("x-dead-letter-exchange", "dlx.exchange.name")
            .build();

This allows you to implement robust error handling and message recovery with minimal configuration.
